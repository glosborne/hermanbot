# Herman bot for Discord

Herman is an simple Discord bot.  It watches the server for the secret word of the day (always a noun), 
and when someone enters the word the bot responds with "AHHHHHHHHHHHH @user said the secret word!!!!"  Yes, it's goofy, 
and yes I watched Pee Wee's Playhouse as a kid.  

The secret word is changed daily.

## Using the public bot

If you want to invite Herman to your existing server, just point your browser at https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=688410847441322176&scope=bot .

## Usage

You don't have to do anything.  Herman just watches the server, and responds when the secret word is said.


## Support

[Report an issue](https://github.com/nonbinarycoding/) if you have problems.


## Notes

The file for the secret words came from http://www.desiquintans.com/nounlist and it's being updated all the time.
